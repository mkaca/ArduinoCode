-Capacitors, integrated circuits, semiconductors (lesson 27) (NE555P)
-optocoupler  -  kind of like a relay except using light: uses high voltage to turn on light inside optocoupler,
 which triggers lower voltage to another ciruit

NOTE: for relay, connect the power of the motor (thing youre relaying), to lower node, opposite from Grnd, 
 - connect connector(signal) opposite from IN1 (to middle node)
- connect ground to arduino GRND
======================================================
NOTES:
======================================================
-Buzzer doesnt need resistor
-attach voltage to object +, then resistor and connection to object -, then other side of resistor to (common)ground
-cathode = ground  , since in electrolytic cell, cathode is negative, and anode is positive.
